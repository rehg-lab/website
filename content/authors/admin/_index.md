James M. Rehg (pronounced “ray”) is a Professor in the School of Interactive Computing at the Georgia Institute of Technology, where he is Director of the Center for Behavioral Imaging, co-Director of the Center for Computational Health, and co-Director of the Computational Perception Lab. He received his Ph.D. from CMU in 1995 and worked at the Cambridge Research Lab of DEC (and then Compaq) from 1995-2001, where he managed the computer vision research group. He received an NSF CAREER award in 2001 and a Raytheon Faculty Fellowship from Georgia Tech in 2005. He and his students have received a number of best paper awards, including best student paper awards at ICML 2005, BMVC 2010, Mobihealth 2014, Face and Gesture 2015, and a Method of the Year award from the journal Nature Methods. Dr. Rehg serves on the Editorial Board of the Intl. J. of Computer Vision, and he served as the General co-Chair for CVPR 2009 and is serving as the Program co-Chair for CVPR 2017 (Puerto Rico). He has authored more than 100 peer-reviewed scientific papers and holds 23 issued US patents. Dr. Rehg’s research interests include computer vision, machine learning, behavioral imaging, and mobile health (mHealth). He is the Deputy Director of the NIH Center of Excellence on Mobile Sensor Data-to-Knowledge (MD2K), which is developing novel on-body sensing and predictive analytics for improving health outcomes. Dr. Rehg is also leading a multi-institution effort, funded by an NSF Expedition award, to develop the science and technology of Behavioral Imaging— the capture and analysis of social and communicative behavior using multi-modal sensing, to support the study and treatment of developmental disorders such as autism.
