# Short Bio
I have a general research interest in computer vision, specifically in incremental learning and 3D shape reconstruction and categorization. I am also interested in studying machine perception from a develop
ntal learning perspective.

During my bachelor's I did Summer research projects with [Michael Lawrence](https://personal.broadinstitute.org/lawrence/) at the [Broad Institute](https://www.broadinstitute.org/) and with [Sven Anderson](https://www.bard.edu/academics/faculty/details/?id=45) at [BSRI](http://www.bard.edu/academics/additional/details/?id=9540623) (Bard Summer
search Institute).
