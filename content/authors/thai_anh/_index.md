# Short Bio
My research interests lie broadly in the field of Computer Vision inspired by developmental psychology and cognitive science. I am currently working on continual learning, 3D shape reconstruction and social behavior understanding.

Prior to PhD, I graduated with a B.S. in Computer Science from Georgia Tech. During my undergrad, I was a Software Engineering Intern at Google in summer 2017 and summer 2018, working in Ads teams.
