The NIH [announced](https://ic.gatech.edu/news/637122/georgia-tech-6-collaborators-receive-59-million-nih-grant-national-center-ai-based) that it is funding a new biomedical technology research center (BTRC), called the *mHealth Center for Discovery, Optimization & Translation of Temporally-Precise Interventions* ([mDOT](https://mdot.md2k.org/)). The $5.9M center is among the first two BTRCs to be funded in mobile health. Georgia Tech will be leading one of the three [center projects](https://mdot.md2k.org/trd1.html), entitled *Enabling the Discovery of Temporally-Precise Intervention Targets and Timing Triggers from mHealth Biomarkers via Uncertainty-Aware Modeling of Personalized Risk Dynamics*. The [BRTC Program](https://www.nibib.nih.gov/research-funding/featured-programs/ncbib/supported-centers) is designed to advance the development of instrumentation and methodology that addresses the emerging needs of the biomedical research community.
