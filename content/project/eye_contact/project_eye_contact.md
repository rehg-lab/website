summary: "Overt visual attention, or the ability to direct our gaze to different parts of the environment around us, plays a critical role in intelligent behavior, from perception and learning to action and communication. We are developing systems and algorithms to help capture important information about human visual attention in a variety of settings, including systems for automatically detecting social gaze behaviors and non-invasive, real-world gaze measurement systems."
