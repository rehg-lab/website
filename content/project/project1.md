summary: "Devising new ways to “image” social behavior in children"
---
Naturalistic human behavior presents a complex, multidimensional signal that, while sometime difficult to quantify, is invaluable for understanding and improving human health, development, and everyday functioning. This project aims to develop novel computational methods for measuring and analyzing human behavior to promote scientific and practical advances across a range of disciplines, just as techniques developed for brain imaging have revolutionized neuroscience and medicine. A particular focus of this project is devising new ways to “image” social behavior in children, to better understand and address issues related to atypical patterns of social and cognitive development such as those experienced by children with autism.
